# StardewGuru - First Iteration
This project is the first iteration of a Python codebase designed to detect specific keywords in Reddit posts and respond to them. The responses are generated by a custom GPT model created using OpenAI, which answers all questions related to Stardew Valley.

## Project Description
The initial version of this project aimed to:

- Monitor Reddit posts for specific keywords related to Stardew Valley.
- Respond to detected keywords with answers generated by a custom GPT model.
- Provide an easy-to-understand interface for displaying the interaction logs.

## Current Status
This basic version of the Stardew Valley GPT Responder is currently a portfolio project demonstrating the initial efforts and methodology. While it provides a glimpse into the foundational work, it lacks the advanced features and refinements planned for future iterations.

## Future Development
A more advanced version of this project is under development and will include:

- Improved keyword detection to ensure accurate identification of relevant posts.
- Enhanced response generation with more context-aware answers.
- Additional custom GPT prompts to cover a broader range of Stardew Valley topics.
- A user-friendly interface for better interaction tracking and logging.

Stay tuned for updates and the official release of the advanced version!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with running the code.
